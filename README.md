# Visual Programming: Subject Work

This repository contains the work for the **Visual Programming** subject. The purpose of this project is to explore and demonstrate the concepts of visual programming using **C#**. The work involves designing and implementing a visual programming environment where users can create programs through a graphical interface instead of traditional text-based coding.

## Objective

The main objective of this subject work is to:

- Understand the concepts behind visual programming languages.
- Create a visual programming environment using **C#** that allows users to design programs through a node-based interface.
- Demonstrate the ease and accessibility of visual programming for those who are new to programming.

## Features

- **Node-based Programming**: Users can design programs using graphical nodes representing different operations and data flows.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive interface for building programs by dragging and connecting nodes.
- **Real-time Execution**: See the immediate result of the visual design as the program executes.
- **Extendable System**: Ability to integrate new components and nodes into the system, making it flexible for future work.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built to be compatible with both Windows and Mac environments.

## How to Use

This repository is intended as a demonstration for the **Visual Programming** subject. To use it:

1. Open the project in an IDE like **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Run the project to start the visual programming environment.
3. Use the drag-and-drop interface to create and connect nodes.
4. Configure the nodesâ€™ properties and run the program to see how it executes.

For further information on how the system works, please refer to the documentation and code within the repository.

## Purpose of the Work

This subject work serves as an exploration into the **C#** language and its application in building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The project aims to provide insights into:

- The fundamentals of visual programming.
- How to represent logic and program flow visually.
- The technical aspects of creating a drag-and-drop environment for programming.

## Acknowledgements
